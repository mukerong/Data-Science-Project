# US-Births 1994-2014

> Find the patterns from US new borns data.

## Introduction

This file will be my first data analysis practice using data of the US births from 1994 to 2014. The data can me found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/births).

## Quesitons to be answered:

* During these 20 years, is there a year that has significant more new births than the other?
* Within a year, which month has the most new babies?
* Within a week, what day has the most new babies?
* I am interested in the 12 zodiacs, so which zodiac has the most people for the past 20 years.

## Interesting facts:

- Most babies are born between 2006 and 2007 before the financial crisis. There might be some relationshi between high birth rates and good economy condition, which could be analyzed using data related to economy condition.
- Most babies are born between July to September, which causes the biggest number of 'Leo' and 'Virgo'.
- Compared to weekdays, not many babies are born during weekends. Maybe people do not want to using their weekends to have babies.

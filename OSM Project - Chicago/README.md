# OpenStreetMap Project - Chicago

This project will use the map of a beautiful city, Chicago, IL, United States. I have lived here since graduating from college. I am very interested to see what the map database reveals. After unziping, the total database is a little more than 2GB.

I will analyze this dataset by doing the following:

* Extract a sample from the database.
* Find the problems encountered in this dataset. 
* Clean up the data and import them to SQL.
* Explore the data by querying in SQLite.
* Additional ideas I have after exploring the dataset.

Reference:

* The summary of Chicago area can be found at [OpenStreetMap website](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/122604). 
* This data can be downloaded at [Mapzen Metro Extracts](https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/chicago_illinois/). 
* [OpenStreetMap Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) shows the detail explanation of OpenStreetMap database.

# Titanic Analysis

This analysis uses the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. 

Here are some questions this analysis will answer:

* Are women more likely to survive than men?
* Are kids more likely to survive than others?
* Are 1st class people more likely to survive than others?
* When combining all factors together, which kind of people are more likely to survive?

I am learning sklean module in Python right now. After finishing, I will include the machine learning into this dataset to It will not project a machine learning analysis to predict who will survive in this disaster.

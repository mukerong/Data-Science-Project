# Data Science Project

> A place to play with Data, explore truth and discover the world from a different perspective

## Introduction

Being able to tell a story using data is more critical than ever. This repository will share various data science projects I work on. Feel free to fork them, and let me know if anything I can do to make improvement! You can contact me at rachelfu63@gmail.com.

## Getting Started

### Overview
This program will include various data science projects. 

I will also make some notes, which will all be saved in [Toolkits](https://github.com/rachelfu/Toolkit).

Stories and findings will also be shared through my [blog](mukerong.com) and [medium](https://medium.com/@mukerong).

### Prerequisites

These projects requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python modules installed:

* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)

You will also need to install and run [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you have not had Python installed yet, it is highly recommended to install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

If there are additional modules needed for each project, it will be explained in README.md file in each project folder.

## Running

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory and run one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook XXX.ipynb
```

or 

```bash
ipython notebook XXX.ipynb
```

If there are special instructions, they will be provided in the project folder.

# Data Science Project

I am new to data science world. I am passionate about technology, analytical thinking and learning. This is the repository that contains all the data science project I did. 

I will use various open datasets online as well as the data I extracted through my [web crawler](https://github.com/rachelfu/Web-Crawler).

I would love to accept pointers from others to improve the analysis and make the code more efficient. If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at rachelfu63@gmail.com.
